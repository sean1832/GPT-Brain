### Description
This program leverages the power of [GPT-3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3) & [3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) to provide a summary of the content of atomic notes, 
as well as answer questions related specifically to your notes. 
The program scans a designated directory, 
which is typically a vault containing multiple notes, 
and appends the contents of all the notes to a single file. 
This file then serves as the context for the user's query. 
The program is able to identify
relationships between the contents of the notes, 
and generate a refined response that summarizes the key points.

Although the program is compatible with other note-taking software that uses
markdown or txt, 
it is primarily designed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in mind. 

### Feature
- [x] Use [OpenAI GPT-3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3) and [GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) to generate response.
